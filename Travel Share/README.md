Travel Share is an interactive user oriented project for posting albums and chatting with other users. (Short video demo included in the project)


The purpose of the system is to make a platform where multiple users can create accounts and login them in order to post information and pictures of their travel journeys.
The system allows a registered user to create an album by selecting a bunch of photos from his personal PC gallery and giving a name and description to the album. The Index page
contains all albums from all users. The Profile page allows a user to manipulate his self published albums. A user can rename or delete an album, change its description or add more
photos. A user can like/dislike other people's albums on the Index page. The Index Page also contains search by username(lists all the albums from a given username) or by album 
name (lists all albums containing the selected expression in their name). 


Other main functionality of the system is the live chatroom where users can send messages to one another. Everytime a user enters the chat, all previous messages are displayed and
all new messages are displayed instantly to all users who are logged in the chat (live client-server chat using web sockets).


The system lacks user interface (almost pure css with no additional libraries were used, because the main purpose was to test all the functionalities), but in future it will 
be updated.
