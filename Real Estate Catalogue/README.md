Real Estate Catalogue is a multifunctional catalogue with the purpose to be of help in the daily job of every real estate broker.
 
The system allows every real estate broker to add information (such as property type, room numbers, size, location, floors, type of building, link and description of the initial 
offer) by creating and adding an entry in the database for a property which is for sale. The Index page lists all offers (entries) which the broker has saved in the catalogue 
(database). He can then delete or update each offer by selecting the Edit Page. There a broker can change all details about a selected offer and save the changes so the changed 
offer can be displayed in the index catalogue.

Another main functionality is the search page. There the user can select multiple criteria (e.g. Listing all apartments with more than 3 rooms and bigger than 100 square feet in
a selected region) and all properties that match the selected criteria will be displayed under the search menu.

Future update of the system will allow the user to paste a link of a property (e.g. from a website like www.imot.bg) and the system will automatically scrape all the needed data
from the link and post it in the database by creating a new entry in the catalogue. The system will also allow the user to post images for every entry in the catalogue.
